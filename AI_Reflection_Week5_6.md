# Reflection: AI-Assisted Modeling & Form Design (~500 words)

**Prompts tried:** (paste a few)
- "Propose a Post/Tag schema for a blog with analytics in mind."
- "Write a Django ModelForm with custom clean methods and Bootstrap widgets."

**What helped:** summarize specific suggestions you accepted.

**What hindered:** note hallucinations, overly-generic advice, missing constraints.

**Your judgment:** where you overrode AI, why, and what you learned.
